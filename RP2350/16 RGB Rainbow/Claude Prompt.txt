I am demonstrating a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and need three code examples that demonstrate a rainbow running a ring of 16x WS2812's on GP28 / pin 34, which slowly gets faster and faster.

1) Arduino using FastLED
2) MicroPython
3) C (in VS Code) using FastLED

For that last one, I then want to demonstrate compiling it for ARM, and then for RISCV, so maybe if its RISCV the rainbow should run backwards. I'll need the compilation commands.

I'm running on Linux Mint Mate 21.
